# IdAMDb

I want to extend my current system to include the concept of "applications". 
An admin should be able to select an application, add a user to it, and then assign their role. 
This involves a few steps:

Database Changes: 
I need to add a new table for "Applications". 
This table should have a many-to-many relationship with "Users" 
(a user can have access to multiple applications and an application can have multiple users). 
I also need a junction table to store this relationship.

UI Changes: 
I need to modify the admin interface to include the ability to select an application, 
add a user to it, and assign their role.

Backend Changes: 
You need to modify your backend to handle these new operations. 
This includes changes to your models and controllers.

Here's a rough pseudocode outline of how I need to implement this:

Add an "Applications" table to your database.
Add a "UserApplications" table to your database to store the many-to-many relationship between users and applications.
Modify your User model to include a list of Applications.
Modify your Application model to include a list of Users.
Add a new method to your User service to add a user to an application.
Add a new method to your Role service to assign a role to a user for a specific application.
Modify your admin interface to include a dropdown to select an application.
Modify your admin interface to include a form to add a user to the selected application and assign their role.


after adding the apps and userapplications tables and relationships:
This code creates a new AppRole table and establishes a many-to-many relationship between App and 
ApplicationRole through the AppRole table. It also updates the ApplicationRoleClaim table to 
reference the AppRole table instead of the Roles table, 
ensuring each role claim is associated with a specific role in a specific app.
